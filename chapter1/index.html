    <p>Matcha is a finely ground powder made from specially grown and processed green tea leaves. Unlike regular green tea, where the leaves are steeped and discarded, matcha is whisked into water or milk, so the entire leaf is consumed, offering higher levels of antioxidants and nutrients. Originating in Japan, matcha has been used in traditional tea ceremonies for centuries and is now popular worldwide for its vibrant color, rich flavor, and potential health benefits.</p>
