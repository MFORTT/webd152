        <!-- Our Philosophy -->
        <section class="philosophy">
          <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
          <p>At Pacific Trails Resort, we believe that nature isn‚Äôt just a place, it‚Äôs a mindset. We exist to reconnect people with the peace they forgot they needed. Whether you‚Äôre hiking through coastal forests, stargazing outside your yurt, or listening to the wind sweep across the trails, we want you to slow down and truly breathe.</p>
          <p>Our resort isn‚Äôt built with luxury, it‚Äôs built on purpose:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplicity over excess.</strong> We focus on what really matters: clean air, open skies, and warm fires.</li>
            <li><strong>Presence over pressure.</strong> There‚Äôs no rush here. You move at your pace, on your time.</li>
            <li><strong>Connection over convenience.</strong> From friendly staff to shared stories by the firepit, people matter most.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We don‚Äôt believe in perfect. We believe in real.</p>
